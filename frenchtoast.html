        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Nope! French toast (pain perdu in French) isn't actually from France. Legend has it that a man named Joseph French from the U.S. created the sweet breakfast dish in 1724 and named it after himself. However, that's probably not true: People were frying milk- and egg-soaked bread in Ancient Rome, according to early recipes. </p>
